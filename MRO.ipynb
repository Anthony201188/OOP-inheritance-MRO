    " -As shown by when we print the method resolution order (MRO) the interpreter first initialises class D.\n",

    " -Next it will print `\"initializing class D\".`\n",

    " -Following this it will run the super().__init__() method which will mean the inherited classes constructors will be run.\n",
    "\n",
    " -The super().__init__() will take the inherited classes that are passed in th first line of the class in that order, so in this case the class \"B\" constructor willbe initialised first so `\"initializing class B\"` will be printed. Again this is shown in the MRO print our with \"<class '__main__.B'>\" being shown as second.\n",
    "\n",
    " -Next the \"super().__init__()\" that is on the last line of class A will be ran, this will use the dynamic MRO order and effectivley go back to Class D as \"C\" is passed to Class D to be inherited and when we originally called the super().__init__() and first class \"C\" was ran class D as the second argument to class d was not run it will be run next and therefore appears third in the MRO statement as <class '__main__.C'>\n",
    "\n",
    " -Class C is then run with A as an inherited class so `\"Initializing class C\"` will be printed and again the \"super().__init__()\" on the next line causes the inherited class A thats passed as an argument to Class  to be ran next. Again this is shown in the printed MRO as the 4th in the order <class '__main__.A'>\n",
    "\n",
    " -Class A is ran NO inherited classes and then prints `\"Initializing class A\"` the \"super().__init__()\" on the next line then checks what arguments Class A has and as we have \"self\" it returns the class object shown as the final item in the printed MRO <class 'object'>\n",
    "\n",
    "  ITS GOOD TO THINK OF SUPER() AS \"NEXT\" THAT STEPS THROUGH THE mro ORDER BUT THE mro ORDER IS GENERATED BY A COMPLICATED ALGO called c3 and it might not always be how you think if its a complicated inheritance its best to print the MRO to work with"
